Tool to take a recording of many samples and break it up and name the sections for easy entry into a sampler.
This python script looks at the folder it is in and searches for a settings.txt file, if it is not there it creates a default one and exits. If it finds one it then finds all the .wav files. For each file it finds it extracts the left and right channels and then rectifies them and sums them before running a moving average over the waveform with parameters from the settings file. Then it looks for the first instance of a level going above the threshold pulled from settings calls that the start of the first sample, finds the point that drops below the threshold and calls that the end then adds on a pre delay and post delay (from settings (with non overlap checks)) and calls that the sample. Then it finds the max of the FFT of the sample, gets that frequency and converts it to a pitch and cent remainder and finally outputs the sample as a new file in an output folder with the note name and remainder in the file name.
